MBStoryboardLink
================

Allows you to split your big and unhandy storyboard into smaller parts and connect them via interface builder.


This code is inspired by Rob Browns [RBStoryboardLink](https://github.com/rob-brown/RBStoryboardLink) code.


It's still **work in progress** but I already use it in a project of mine.
